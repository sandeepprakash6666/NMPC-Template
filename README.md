# NMPC Template
 
A simple NMPC template for people who are starting with Julia. 
The code is written like a tank (so not very fast - might make Julia devs roll in their beds), but easy to read and reuse snippets as needed by anyone. 
Have avoided most Julia features that stumped me as a beginner to Julia (and still do).
