# NMPC Template
 
A simple NMPC template for people who are starting with Julia. 
The code is written like a tank (so not very fast - might make Julia devs roll in their beds), but easy to read and reuse snippets as needed by anyone who is starting. 
Have avoided most Julia features that stumped me as a beginner to Julia (and still do). 

Serious gratitude and acknowledgements are owed to carolinesnakama, evrenmturan, JoseMatias14 and SimenBjorvand for their help in clearing my many many Noob coding doubts.
